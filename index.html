      🍽️ Purpose of This Website
The purpose of Flavors of the World is to explore and celebrate the rich diversity of food cultures around the globe. Through this website, visitors can discover traditional dishes from different countries and learn how food reflects each region’s history, lifestyle, and traditions. It aims to show that food is more than just something we eat — it’s a part of our identity, a form of art, and a way to connect people across borders. By sharing recipes, facts, and stories, this website encourages everyone to appreciate cultural differences and find unity through the universal language of food.
